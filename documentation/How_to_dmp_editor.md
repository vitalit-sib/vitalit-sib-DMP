##How to use the DMP Canvas Editor

###Structure of the editor
The editor consists of 2 main modules: the template editor and the recommendation editor. 

The **template editor** can be used to produced institution specific texts in the Word file produced by the DMP Canvas Generator. 

The **recommendation editor** allows institutions to add recommended selections for their users in the questionnaire (for example recommended security standards, licenses). In addition, it provides the possibility to filter the available choices in the questionnaire.  
  

###How to use the Template editor 
The dropdown menu can be used to select a section title, corresponding to a section that will be rendered in the Word document. Once a section is selected, the user can modify the text that appears in the chosen section. Specifically the user can modify the text in 3 places:

**A) Introductory text:** The introductory text of the section that will be rendered regardless of the user's choices.

**B) Text related to the selected parameter:** The main text of the section that depends on the user's choices. Dropdown menus can be used to select the parameter choice for which the text will be modified.

**C) Concluding text:** The concluding text of the section that will be rendered regardless of the user's choices.

In all three cases, a button (`Reset to default text`) can be used to disregard any text modifications. 

Clicking on `Preview`opens a preview of the Word document that will be produced, taking into account the text modifications. Preview supports live editing, allowing the editor to visualize the changes in the Word document as they type. 

###How to use the Recommendation editor
A dropdown menu allows to select a parameter to be edited. All database entries for the chosen parameter are displayed, and the editor has the choice to define whether each entry should be displayed as an option to the user and whether the entry should be flagged as recommended by the institution, by simply clicking on the words `displayed` \ `not displayed` , `recommended` \ `not recommended `.

### Save
When the editor has finished modifying the text and recommentations, they have to save their changes by clicking on the respective button. Please not that each module of the editor has an independent `Save`button.
